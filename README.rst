NOTE: Development on this package is discontinued. It probably won't work with the current version of VoteIT.

---

The possibility to give your vote to someone else and have them represent you.

Terminology
-----------

Representative

  Same as the original meaning of the word. You're able to represent others,
  but other users aren't forced to pick representation. You may be a representative
  without actually representing anyone but yourself.

Delegator

  The person who gives their vote to a representative. They're probably voters too,
  but since they don't want to vote the term would be missleading.
  There may be situations where someone delegated their power to someone without
  having the permission to vote.

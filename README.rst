The possibility to give your vote to someone else and have them represent you.

Note: This is only compatible with the newer version of VoteIT that depends on Arche.
The package is also pretty crude so far, but it gets the job done.

Terminology
-----------

Representative

  Same as the original meaning of the word. You're able to represent others,
  but other users aren't forced to pick representation. You may be a representative
  without actually representing anyone but yourself.

Delegator

  The person who gives their vote to a representative. They're probably voters too,
  but since they don't want to vote the term would be missleading.
  There may be situations where someone delegated their power to someone without
  having the permission to vote.
